	  though.
	  
	  I checked the code history. This bug exists since CitcomS 1.0,
	  but not in CitcomCU nor CitcomT.

2011-10-14 18:27  tan2

	* CitcomS/Components/Output.py, lib/Instructions.c, lib/Output.c,
	  lib/Output_vtk.c, lib/global_defs.h, module/setProperties.c:
	  enhancing VTK output, mostly contributed by Rene Gassmoeller at
	  GFZ.
	  
	  - A new input parameter 'vtk_format', which can be either 'ascii'
	  (default) or 'binary'. When 'binary', gzip and base64 encoding
	  are used. - The node ordering is changed to CitcomS native
	  ordering. The consequence is the axis are rotated as z in CitcomS
	  is mapped to X in vtk, and x to Y, y to Z. - More data can be
	  outputted in vtk format - Using .pvts file for regional model;
	  .vtm and .visit file for global model (.vtm format provided by
	  Tobias Hoeink at Rice, .visit format provided by Kat at
	  visitusers.org/forum)

2010-12-08 18:43  becker

	* lib/global_defs.h: Added definition of TRUE (1) and FALSE (0) in
	  case undefined (was defined for GMT/ggrd compile before).

2010-12-08 00:54  becker

	* lib/BC_util.c: Addded a test for top or bottom nodal row back
	  into horizontal_bc (earlier moved from
	  Regional_boundary_conditions and Full_boundary_conditions to
	  BC_util.c) to see if this helps fix a bug reported by Dan that I
	  could not reproduce in the non-pyre version.

2010-09-07 02:22  becker

	* lib/Citcom_init.c, lib/Tracer_setup.c: Added random number

	* CitcomS/Coupler/Coupler.py, module/Exchanger/BaseSVTInlet.cc,
	  module/Exchanger/BaseSVTInlet.h: Added support of multigrid
	  solver in Exchanger. Lifted the solver assertion in Coupler.
	  
	  Cookbook9 can be converted to multigrid solver once appropriate
	  parameters (*solver.mesher.levels=2 and

	* visual/OpenDXMacro/CitcomSImportOpt.net, visual/visFull.cfg,
	  visual/visFull.net.in: Added opendx macro to visualize opt (e.g.
	  composition) fields. This fixed Issue99.

2010-01-17 01:19  danb

	* lib/Composition_related.c, lib/Tracer_setup.c, lib/tracer_defs.h:
	  Preliminary support for the absolute tracer method. Only tested
	  with one flavor, reading in from a file, and the initial volume
	  of the tracers is HARD-CODED! In addition, the code automaticaly
	  truncates the composition to one, although this should be a

	* lib/Instructions.c, lib/Nodal_mesh.c, lib/Stokes_flow_Incomp.c,
	  lib/Viscosity_structures.c, lib/global_defs.h: Implementation of
	  two, perhaps entirely unnecessary features, in search of why
	  certain prescribed velocity models do not converge like they
	  should.
	  
	  - allow for each inner loop solution to have a higher accuracy
	  than the outer, Uzawa loop. This is set by new parameter
	  "inner_accuracy_scale", which pre-multiplies the inner accuracy
	  (imp) setting (defaults to unity)
	  
	  - remove any rigid body rotation at each Uzawa iteration step.
	  Parmaeter "inner_remove_rigid_rotation", by default off. For
	  this, I also added an experimental routine assign_v_to_vector()
	  in order to reasign the V velocities to the U solution vector
	  after removing the net rotations from V (how is supposed to work
	  for the regular operational mode?)

2009-12-09 02:25  tan2

	  #define VBX 0x2 #define VBY 0x4 #define VBZ 0x8

2009-07-25 02:48  leif

	* lib/multigrid_kernel.cu: Wrote two new versions of

	* lib/multigrid_kernel.cu: This junk is my effort to understand
	  gauss_seidel_2(). Because of the way E->temp[] is used, it is
	  quite difficult (impossible?) to parallelize. I even wrote code
	  to generate a "dot" graph of the expression tree. Of course, this
	  tree is too big to plot in its entirety. With neq == 2187, the
	  tree has 87479 nodes and is 355 levels deep; each level can have
	  anywhere from a handful to several hundred nodes, with over a
	  thousand nodes in each of the bottommost layers.

	  for each of the multigrid kernel functions. After swapping them
	  in/out, it seems n_assemble_del2_u(), gauss_seidel_2(), and
	  gauss_seidel_3() are all buggy :-( Both gauss_seidel_0() and
	  gauss_seidel_1() appear to be OK... but that isn't worth writing

2008-06-19 01:04  tan2

	* lib/Size_does_matter.c, lib/Sphere_harmonics.c: Compute
	  E->surf_det (top surface area, ie. surface jacobian, of an
	  element) on a unit sphere.
	  
	  Use E->surf_det, instead of the surface jacobian returned by
	  get_global_1d_shape_fn(), to expand spherical harmonics.
	  
	  The surface jacobian returned by get_global_1d_shape_fn() is
	  defined at the top radius of the current mesh. When nprocz>1, the
	  top radius is not the same as the outer radius of the sphere for
	  processors. As a result, the spherical harmonics expansion gave
	  incorrect result when nprocz>1 in the previous revisions.

	  - renamed CONTOL structure members ORTHO and ORTHOZ to
	  CITCOM_ORTHO and CITCOM_ORTHOZ Those were never used and
	  conflicted with definitions in GMT gmt.h

	  write_q_files=1 # option to write heat flux to files qt.dat and
	  qb.dat # at intervals smaller than storage_spacing (0)
	  
	  - Added the capability to read in initial temperatures from
	  netcdf grd files, if -USE_GGRD is used. Lot of options, like so:
	  
	  # # read initial temperature conditions from grd files (default
	  values in parentheses) # tic_method=4 # read initial temperature
	  from netcdf GRD files (off)
	  
	  ggrd_tinit_scale_with_prem=off # scale the temperature with PREM

	  f (1.0)
	  
	  ggrd_tinit_offset=-0.5 # offset, T = f * scale + offset + tm
	  (0.0) # where tm is the mean between top and bottom TBC values #
	  if the bottom is flux, will use 1 for bottom TBC value
	  
	  ggrd_tinit_gfile="../../data/tomography/s20a_smean_new_age/t" #

	* lib/Instructions.c, lib/Output.c, lib/Output_gzdir.c,
	  lib/Output_h5.c, lib/Parsing.c: - merged changes with Eh's
	  additions
	  
	  - added coor=2 option (for full citcom) to assign finer radial
	  node spacing to top and lower layers of shell. The
	  coor_refine=0.1,0.15,0.1,0.2 parameter specifies the radius
	  fraction of the bottom layer [0], the fraction of the nodes in
	  this layer [1], the top layer fraction [2], and the top layer
	  node fraction [3]. I.e. the defaults will put 15% of all nz nodes
	  into the 10% lower layer, 20% in the top 10% upper layer, and the
	  rest in between.
	  
	  - renamed gzipped output option ascii-gz
	  
	  - built in restart facilities for temperature and tracers when
	  using gzdir I/O
	  
	  - added a composition viscosity function, CDEPV, based on two
	  tracer flavors
	  
	  - for this to work, I had to move viscosity_input() *behind*
	  tic_input() and tracer_input() in instructions
	  
	  - added tracer_enriched option. If tracer = on and
	  tracer_enriched = on, will reader Q0_enriched and vary the
	  element heat production between Q0 for C = 0 and Q0_enriched for
	  C = 1. I.e. this only works if C varies between 0 and 1.
	  
	  - added an experimental option to write to a single VTK file
	  (note caveats!) if ascii-gz is activated
	  
	  gzdir_vtkio = 2, will try to write VTK straight (experimental)
	  
	  the VTK output is of the "legacy", serial type, and requires that
	  all processors see the same filesystem. This will likely lead to
	  a bottleneck for larg CPU computations as each processor has to
	  wait til the previous is done.

	  lib/global_defs.h, lib/tracer_defs.h: - added new routine
	  Ggrd_handling which will take care of netcdf grd input. For now,
	  only the tracer innitial conditions can be set by using, for
	  example,
	  
	  ictracer_grd_layers=2 ictracer_grd_file="tmask.grd"
	  
	  for this to work, the ggrd libraries from HC, as well as the
	  -lgmt and -lnetcdf need to be linked, and -DUSE_GGRD needs to be
	  defined on compile time.
	  
	  - rewrote TDEPV viscosity options 3 and 4 slightly to make them
	  more efficient
	  
	  - added TDEPV viscosity option 6
	  
	  eta = N_0 exp(E(T_0-T) + (1-z) Z_0 )
	  
	  - took layers subroutine in Construct_arrays.c apart to allow
	  calling the same function in a more flexible from other
	  subroutines
	  
	  - addded error handling routine "myerror" to
	  Pan_problem_misc_functions
	  
	  - made the output behavior of the multigrid solver convergence
	  parameters consisent with verbosity setting (ie. use report
	  instead of always stderr output)
	  
	  - changed tracer input parameter "tracer" and "chemical_buoyancy"
	  to boolean routine for added flexibility (I hope)
	  
	  - made check_initial_composition consistent with tracer
	  advection, exits after warning only for
	  E->trace.itracer_warnings==1
	  
	  - debugging output in Full_tracer_advection.c and Tracer_setup
	  only gets printed to file for E->control.verbose == 1
	  
	  - fixed some typos in Output_gzdir (that might have been
	  introduced by asynchronous svn updating or something like that)

	  lib/Viscosity_structures.c, lib/global_defs.h, lib/output.h,
	  lib/viscosity_descriptions.h: - added functions rtp2xyz,
	  calc_cbase_at_tp, and convert_pvec_to_cvec for spherical to
	  Cartesian vector conversion to Pan_problem_functions.c
	  
	  Added "safe_malloc" to the same file because I didn't like the
	  way Malloc1 uses int as arguments (64 bit issues).
	  
	  - added support for gzipped ascii output into subdirectories of
	  data_dir, option gzdir. To use, need to compile with USE_GZDIR
	  and link with the -lz zlib libraries. Within gzdir output mode,
	  selected by
	  
	  output_format=gzdir user can define vtk I/O (gzdir_vtkio=1) to
	  write Cartesian coordinates and velocities that are easy to
	  combine to a single vtk file in a post-processing step.
	  
	  If gzlib_vtkio=0 the gzdir output option is meant to be identical
	  to the original ascii output, but files are all gzipped on the
	  fly, and the output that changes with each cycle is placed into
	  subdirectories of data_dir/ called data_dir/cycles/ For gzdir
	  I/O, data_name is not used at all, all single output files are
	  placed in the data_dir/ directory without prefix.
	  
	  - added a new rheology option, PDEPV, for pseudo-plasticity and
	  added a corresponding description to the manual.
	  
	  - Modified Drive_solver stderr output to show v.v, and not only
	  dv.dv/v.v

	* lib/Full_read_input_from_files.c: The functionality of this
	  routine is now expanded so that for evey time step the element
	  materials are read in. The code for determining the material file
	  names and opening the file name and then reading in the element
	  files is placed in the same code that the age grids and velocity
	  files are processed. Obviously, reading in materials currently

	  lib/Problem_related.c: Changed the seequence placement in the
	  time step when the age grids are assimilated into the temperature
	  field. Previously, going back to the original code contributed by
	  CC, the assimilation occurred avery time the temperature BCs were
	  set (meaning multiple times in a PC loop). Now assimilation
	  happens only once at the end of the time step. This is placed at
	  the end of the routine PG_time_step_solve. Once we have worked
	  with this some more, we will want to expose this code at a higher
	  level so that assimulation will work properly from either plain C
	  code or the Pyre version. Currently only tested with Full.

	  The previous code computed and stored the Cartesian velocity in

	  velo_from_element. This is bug prone. E->temp is a temporary
	  array and should be used for storage.
	  
	  Also, in previous code, if E->sphere.cap[m].V is modified, one
	  has to recompute E->temp. Otherwise, the Cartesian velocity will
	  be incorrect.

	  The .pth/sitedir/sys.path/PYTHONPATH aspect of eggs is really

	  Python distro, as the Python core developers are likely to accept
	  it uncritically and unmodified (as they are wont to do,
	  apparently -- judging by all the other crap that is in the

	  Using a pidXXXX.cfg file as input should "work" now, although it
	  still doesn't reproduce the original simulation, since at least
	  one parameter is missing ('steps'). I maintain that dumping the
	  configuration is really the job of the framework (Pyre).
	  Unfortunately, Pyre's current capabilities in this area are buggy
	  in the case of '.pml' files, and non-existent in the case of
	  '.cfg' files.
	  
	  Note: 'nproc_surf' is now a real inventory item, instead of a
	  fake one. It looks like it doesn't belong in the inventory at
	  all, though. (I left it there to avoid breakage.)

	  lib/Instructions.c, lib/Output.c, lib/global_defs.h,
	  module/setProperties.c: Changes how to specify output directory
	  
	  * "output_format" must be either "ascii" (the default) or "hdf5",
	  the "ascii-local" option is gone * "datafile" becomes the prefix
	  of the filename and cannot contain "/" * "datadir" becomes
	  mandatory input parameters * If "datadir" is "%DATADIR", the
	  output directory is determined by an external program
	  "citcoms_datadir" * Special substrings "%RANK", "%HOSTNAME" in
	  datadir will be substituted by mpi rank, machine's hostname,
	  $DATADIR environment variable, respectively. * These special
	  strings start with "%", rather than "$", becuase it's very
	  difficult to input "$" from the command line.

	  written in the .time file anyway.) * Where to put 2d and 1d

	  "CitcomS" == "citcoms".
	  
	  Fixed egg-related bugs which prevented 'configure' from
	  succeeding when buildir != srcdir (another BuildBot test vector).
	  
	  Call addsitedir() in the 'citcoms' script. I guess this is now
	  necessary since "site.py" is no longer in the same directory as
	  "citcoms". (*)
	  
	  Note that there is currently a bug in Merlin which prevents
	  'citcoms' from running ("No module named pkg_resources"). The
	  work-around is to manually add the merlin egg to the
	  merlin-install.pth file.
	  
	  There are more bugs which prevent running on Mac OS X at all
	  (still investigating).
	  
	  (*) I'm becoming annoyed with setuptools' use of .pth files as a
	  sys.path/PYTHONPATH persistence mechanism, mainly because of the
	  accompanying hacks which are used to turn ordinary directories
	  into "site" directories (i.e., directories where .pth files work)
	  -- these ugly, confusing hacks include the fake site.py, "virtual
	  python", etc. I think Merlin will only use .pth files in real
	  site directories. It will use clear, straitforward, direct
	  sys.path manipulation everywhere else.

	  As I was revising the "Installation" chapter of the manual (still
	  in progress), I got frustrated with how complicated everything
	  was -- and how difficult it was to document that complexity -- so
	  I did something slightly violent:
	  
	  Converted the CitcomS extension module, 'CitcomSLib', from C++ to
	  C. This is made possible by Pythia 0.8.1.0b2, which replaces
	  _mpimodule with _mpi.pyx, which has a C interface.
	  
	  It is now possible to build CitcomS -- and all its prerequisites
	  (e.g. Python) -- entirely from source, starting with nothing but
	  a C compiler. Exchanger still requires C++, of course. I have yet
	  to test these changes with Exchanger enabled, but I don't
	  anticipate any serious problems.
	  
	  This may have been overkill, but I also cleaned the source of
	  C++-style comments (even though most modern C compilers probably
	  accept them... it became standard in C99 or something).
	  
	  I'll bet you can install CitcomS with GCC 2.x now :-)

	* bin/Makefile.am, bin/pycitcoms.cc, configure.ac, ez_setup.py,
	  module/Exchanger/Makefile.am, module/Makefile.am, setup.py: Made
	  'Exchanger' optional. Give "--with-exchanger=[yes|no]" as an
	  argument to 'configure' to manually specify whether you want
	  Exchanger; the default is "auto", which means to use Exchanger if
	  it's installed (and on your PYTHONPATH).
	  
	  Egg-ified 'configure' checks for Python packages. This means that
	  CitcomS now requires the egg-ified CIG version of Pythia -- and
	  (optionally) the egg-ified Exchanger. Old Pythia/Exchanger
	  installations will not work, as they lack the egg-metadata
	  ('configure' will act as if they are not installed).
	  
	  Added 'setup.py', which will automatically download and install
	  the egg version of Pythia -- as well as the egg system itself
	  ('setuptools'). If you want Exchanger, you still must install it
	  manually (the way C++ is used prevents complete egg-ification of
	  Exchanger). Note that 'setup.py' actually checks-out the latest
	  Pythia from the SVN repository. The release version of CitcomS
	  will download a packaged Pythia from the website instead.

	  and restart=1, the restart files will be read from
	  ${datadir_old}/${rank}/${datafile_old}.velo.${rank}.${step}. In

	  output_format=="ascii-local" (the default), CitcomS will write
	  ascii files to the directory and prefix specified by "datafile",
	  ie., the same behavior as in v2.0 * If output_format=="ascii",
	  CitcomS will write ascii files to the directory specified by
	  "datadir" with the prefix specified by "datafile". In the case,
	  "datafile" cannot contains the '/' (path seperator) character. *
	  If output_format=="hdf5", CitcomS will write singe HDf5 file to
	  the directory and prefix specified by "datafile".

2006-09-21 17:51  tan2

	* CitcomS/Controller.py, CitcomS/Solver/Solver.py,
	  module/bindings.cc, module/misc.cc, module/misc.h: Completely
	  fixed issue35 (inconsistent times) and related problems * t, dt,
	  step are modified only in the C code. Their python counterparts
	  are read-only * Changed the ancestor of the Controller from
	  Pyre's SimulationController to Pyre's Component, as the
	  SimulationController hinders the use of read-only properties *
	  Changed the ancestor of the Solver from Pyre's Solver to Pyre's
	  Component, as Pyre's Solver hinders the use of read-only
	  properties

2006-07-31 23:07  tan2

	* lib/Instructions.c: Changed the default value of 'layerd' from
	  2800 km (the depth of the mantle) to 6371 km (the radius of the

	  lib/Instructions.c, lib/Output.c, lib/global_defs.h,
	  module/mesher.cc: Moved the responsibility of time output from
	  Citcom.c and Solver.py to Output.c, which includes the following
	  changes * open .time file at either mesher.cc (for pyre run) or
	  Instructions.c (for C run) * .time file is opened and closed only
	  by the rank-0 processor. This will avoid multiple processors
	  opening/writing/closing on the same file. Similar modification is
	  necessary for the .log file. * created two variables
	  E->monitor.cpu_time_at_start and
	  E->monitor.cpu_time_at_last_cycles for storing the wall clock
	  time at startup and last timestep, respectively * output .time
	  file in output_time() in Output.c

	  configuration with autoconf.

2006-07-24 11:18  luis

	  tests/Makefile.am, tests/citcomsfull.sh.in,

	  the capability to embed Python instead of extending it. This
	  creates one, big monolithic executable, 'pycitcoms', which
	  contains all CitcomS code and an embedded Python interpreter.
	  Embedding works-around MPI portability issues. (See issue15 for
	  details.) Embed by default.
	  
	  Configure with '--disable-embedding' to build the old way with
	  ".so" extension modules. This is *NOT* guaranteed to work unless
	  you have a shared MPI library. The ugly hacks which made it work
	  in the past (even with a static "libmpich.a", for example) are no
	  longer supported.
	  
	  Merged "Full" and "Regional" into a single library to cut down on
	  redundancy, both in the source code and in the amount of object
	  code which is produced. (I performed this merge so that I would
	  only need a single 'pycitcoms' intepreter, instead of two.)

	  in unusual cases. Also, 'sed' the install-time PYTHONPATH into
	  CitComS scripts (instead of an explicit list of @pythondir@'s).
	  
	  Added _getPrivateDepositoryLocations() and CitcomS.pml. Changed
	  "etc/citcoms" to "etc/CitcomS" for consistency with the Python
	  package name. Add PACKAGE_VERSION to __init__.py, and added
	  pyconfig-generated config.py. Freeze the full path to 'mpirun'

	  invovled creating CitcomS's own version of LauncherMPICH, and
	  tweaking the MPI launchers so that CitcomS re-execs itself under
	  'mpipython.exe' when it is run under plain old 'python'. Also:
	  made "--launcher.dry" work; ignore 'nodegen' in LauncherBatch (so
	  that the examples "just work" on the TeraGrid); added some 'tips'
	  ("--launcher.help-properties"); added SimpleApp.usage().
