This file was generated by GPlates 1.2.0 (http://www.gplates.org) 

This file is used to record the mapping between shapefile attributes 
and GPlates model properties for a specific shapefile. 

The file consists of lines of the form <TagName>ShapefileAttribute</TagName> 
where TagName should be one of the recognised tabs listed below. 

For example, a line of the form: 

<ReconstructionPlateId>PLATEID</ReconstructionPlateId> 

indicates that the shapefile attribute with the name PLATEID will be used to 
generate GPlates gpml:ReconstructionPlateId properties. 

The following tags are recognised: 

Tag name ................ Description 
=====================.... ================================================================ 
ReconstructionPlateId ... The plate id used in reconstruction (gpml:reconstructionPlateId). 
FeatureType ............. The type of feature. 
FeatureId................ The (unique) identifier of the feaure. 
Begin ................... The age of appearance (gml:begin part of gml:validTime). 
End ..................... The age of disappearance (gml:end part of gml:validTime). 
Name .................... The name of the feature (gml:name). 
Description ............. A description of the feature (gml:description). 
ConjugatePlateId......... The conjugate plate id. 

On loading a shapefile, GPlates will use the mapping stored in this file, if it exists. 
If no such file exists, GPlates will generate a file according to the mapping 
selected by the user during file loading. 

The user can edit the mapping within GPlates by
selecting File->ManageFeatureCollections and clicking the shapefile's 
Edit Configuration icon, or by editing this file manually. 
If the mapping is changed from within GPlates, this file will be overwritten.
