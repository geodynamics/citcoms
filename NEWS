Trunk:

* New capability to read in time- and geographic-dependent, top
  surface temperature boundary conditions

Version 3.0.2
?

Version 3.0.1

* A header file for the exchanger was missing in v3.0.0.


Version 3.0.0

This release of CitcomS (3.0) contains many new features, including:

* two implementations of compressible convection, one by Wei Leng and Shijie
  Zhong and the other by Eh Tan (Cookbook 8);

* the ability to resume computation from previous checkpoints (Cookbook 8);

* multi-component chemical convection;

* a fixed non-Newtonian solver;

* an exchanger package for solver coupling (Cookbook 9);

* removing the rigid body rotation component from the velocity by Shijie
  Zhong (Cookbook 8);

* an option to disable monitoring of maximum temperature (Cookbook 9);

* a rheology option for pseudo-plasiticity, composition dependent viscosity
  and heat generation, compressed ASCII output, and an easier way for mesh
  refinement for the radial coordinate by Thorsten Becker.


There are additional seven backward-incompatible changes. Among them, the
first four will affect the results. The same input file will produce slightly
different results in v3.0.0 than in v2.2.2.

* the viscosity field at element level is not smoothed (this might slow down
  the convergence but will represent the viscosity field more accurately);

* the Lenardic filter on temperature is disabled by default;

* the rigid body rotation component is removed from the velocity by default;

* use of a better pseudo-random number generator to generate the initial
  tracer;

* the type of input parameter coor is changed from a boolean to an integer;

* setting restart=on will resume the computation from the checkpoint files and
  will not need the tracer files (the old way of reading  initial temperature
  from velo files can be achieved by tic_method=-1);

* the input parameter reset_initial_composition becomes obsolete.  


Version 2.2.2

* A bug in geoid calculation is fixed. The buoyancy contribution on geoid
  was not correctly zeroed before every geoid calculation. This caused the
  geoid at former timestep accumulated over the later timestep. (Issue 114)

* The pressure, stress, and composition output, if enabled, will be combined
  by "autocombine.py" script as well. The combined output is stored in
  opt-files, similar to the cap-files. (Issue 99)

* Generating random tracers is sped up. This should avoid a potential problem
  of "too many tries?" error when the domain size of a processor is much
  smaller (<1%) than the size of the whole sphere.


Version 2.2.1

* One example, Cookbook7, was missing in v2.2.0.


Version 2.2.0

* A new feature to track particles in the flow (code donated by Allen McNamara
  and Shijie Zhong).

* A new feature to use the tracers to compute composition field and compute
  thermo-chemical convection (code donated by Allen McNamara and Shijie Zhong).
  A new cookcook (Cookbook7) in the manual introduces how to use this feature.

* New feature to use the tracers to define the low viscosity wedges/channels
  in the subduction zones (code donated by Vlad Manea).

* Fixes of sevearal bugs: issue 72, 73, 75, 77 and 81. See the Geodynamics
  Roundup issue tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) and the file 
  ChangeLog for details. Important bug fixes include:

  - 'make install' broken for non-pyred CitcomS. (Issue 72)

  - 'autocombine.py' did not work in Ubuntu 6.10. (Issue 73)

  - Velocity b.c not scaled correctly when age becomes negative. When using
    file_vbcs=on and the age becomes negative (passing the present time),
    the read-in velocity BC was not scaled properly. Usually the boundary
    velocity became ~1000x smaller than it should be. (Issue 77)
  
  - Errors in the manual. The manual failed to document the unit of the
    vbc_file is in cm/yr. The manual contained a small error in the
    description of the header of the coor_file. (Issue 75 and 81)


Version 2.1.0

* The filenames of post-processed and combined data are changed slightly. For 
  example, "model.cap0.100" is renamed to "model.cap00.100", "model.cap6.100" 
  is renamed to "model.cap06.100", and "model.cap11.100" is unchanged.

* A new input parameter "datadir" specifies the path of output files. The
  "datafile" input parameter (cannot contain path) specifies the filename
  prefix of the output files. In v2.0.x and before, "datafile" is used to
  specify the path and filename prefix of output files. This change is not
  backward compatible. Users need to change their old input file to run it.

* Improved build procedure. The CitComS executable embeds python
  interpreter by default and is statically linked with MPI library,
  which improves the portability of the code. 

* New input format (INI-styled .cfg)

* No need to specify launcher.nodes anymore, it is calculated from the mesher
  properties.

* Support of binary format output (using HDF5 library).

* Additional data output (including: geoid, stress, pressure, and horizontal
  average) can be enabled/disabled by changing the input parameters.

* Scripts (using GMT commands) to plot 2-D cross sections of temperature field.

* Added/removed a few input parameters (all in solver.const component) for
  computing geoid. Removed "layerd" and "wdensity" and added "radius", 
  "density_above" and "density_below".

* Fixes for several bugs: issue 30, 35, 42, 44 and 55. See the Geodynamics
  Roundup issue tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) and the file
  ChangeLog for details. Important bug fixes include:

  - Inconsistent times in C and Pyre. When 'fixed_timestep' is set
    and the grid resolution is insufficient, the Pyre part of CitComS
    could give the wrong model time. (Issue 35)

  - Accidental deletion of surf files by batchsurf.py. batchsurf.py is a script
    to combine the surf files. If the current working directory happens to be
    the output directory of CitcomS, the script would delete the original surf
    files. (Issue 55)


Version 2.0.2

* Fixes for several minor bugs: issues 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
  Most of these are installation-related.  See the Geodynamics Roundup
  issue tracker (http://geodynamics.org/roundup) and the file ChangeLog
  for details.
