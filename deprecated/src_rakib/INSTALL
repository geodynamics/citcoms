Installation Instructions
************************* 

Installation of CitcomS requires the following:

  * A C compiler

  * An MPI library

  * If using Pyre, Python 2.3 or greater (Python 2.4 or greater is required 
    on 64-bit machines), including header files (Python.h).


The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system. 

     Several optional features are disabled by default. Type
     `./configure --help' to list all available options.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

More installation instruction can be found in the manual.
